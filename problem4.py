#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
#from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#The original problem only requires the palindrome, but I figure it's more meaningful to return the two 3-digit numbers that of which the palindrome is product.
